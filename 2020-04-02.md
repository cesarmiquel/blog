## Creating beautiful and engaging infographics and slides

Visme is a content creation tool for making presentations and infographs. They have a lot of resources on their site.  I found two presentations they made to be an excellent source of ideas and tips on creating presentations and infographs.

## Upload files to Amazon S3 with a bash script

The other day I was backing up a really old machine that had Centos 5.4. I started going over the Amazon CLI documentation and noticed it was going to be painfull to try to install this on such an old server. My next idea was starting to search for simple S3 client that would allow me to upload files (which the only thing I really needed to do). Somehow I came across [this Github gist](https://gist.github.com/chrismdp/6c6b6c825b07f680e710) which is basically a **bash** script that uses **openssl** and **curl** to upload files into an S3 bucket. I run the code but had an error. After a little Googling it turned out it was a security bug in OpenSSL. I updated the OpenSSL library with a version from Centos 5.11 and it worked! So ... if you need to upload files to an Amazon S3 with curl and OpenSSL this is it!

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# You don't need Fog in Ruby or some other library to upload to S3 -- shell works perfectly fine
# This is how I upload my new Sol Trader builds (http://soltrader.net)
# Based on a modified script from here: http://tmont.com/blargh/2014/1/uploading-to-s3-in-bash

S3KEY="[YOUR AMAZON KEY HERE]"
S3SECRET="[YOUR AMAZON SECRET HERE]"

function putS3
{
  path="${1}"
  aws_path="${2}"
  bucket='[YOUR BUCKET HERE]'
  date=$(date +"%a, %d %b %Y %T %z")
  acl="x-amz-acl:public-read"
  content_type='application/x-compressed-tar'
  string="PUT\n\n$content_type\n$date\n$acl\n/$bucket$aws_path"
  signature=$(echo -en "${string}" | openssl sha1 -hmac "${S3SECRET}" -binary | base64)
  curl -X PUT -T "$path" \
    -H "Host: $bucket.s3.amazonaws.com" \
    -H "Date: $date" \
    -H "Content-Type: $content_type" \
    -H "$acl" \
    -H "Authorization: AWS ${S3KEY}:$signature" \
    "https://$bucket.s3.amazonaws.com$aws_path"
}

echo "Uploading [$2]..."
putS3 "$1" "$2"
```

## MVP.css â€” Minimalist stylesheet for HTML elements

This is something I've been searching for a long, long time. Not sure this is the style I like most but the idea is what matters. It's simple: a CSS file that adds styling to the basic HTML elements **without** any additional classes. You write a plain and simple HTML file and add the CSS to get a decent experience (much better than the browser's default). Get it [here](https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp) and whatch a demo [here](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/). This is how Google Page Speed will treat you if you use this:

## Drupal + AMP Presentation - DrupalCon Seattle 2019

Karen Stevenson, Director of Technology @Lullabot talks gives a talk about the state of AMP in Drupal in 2019. Lullabot have been maintaining the AMP integration since 2016 so she definitely knows how to integrate AMP with Drupal. Check the [YouTube video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xwylhanzEo)
