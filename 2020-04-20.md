## ‚óª Sizecoding: incredible tiny demos and more

This week HellMood released [a thorough explanation to his 256 byte intro](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Memories). In his article he mentions a *lot* of tiny demos I hadn't head of. Some of them looked really cool. I also hadn't heard of the [sizecoding wiki](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page) where you can find a lot of resources related to sizecoding. All of this triggered the idea of creating *another* Github repo with my favorite mini demos intros: [here it is](https://github.com/cesarmiquel/tiny-demos)

## ‚óª Coding fonts

Last week I updated my Ubuntu to **19.10** and in the process seem to have lost the coding font I was using. I searched for whats new in 2020 and after a couple of different tests I settled on two fonts:

### Monoid

[Monoid](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/) - This is a little more condensed so it is a little more crowded. I get good/readable results with 9 or 10.

### Hack

[Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) - I'm currently using Hack Regular 10

I honestly love ‚ù§Ô∏è  both fonts so I'm kind of constantly switching between them :-).
