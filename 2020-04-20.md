- Sizecoding: incredible tiny demos and more


## ◻ Sizecoding: incredible tiny demos and more

This week HellMood released [a thorough explanation to his 256 byte intro](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Memories). In his article he mentions a *lot* of tiny demos I hadn't head of. Some of them looked really cool. I also hadn't heard of the [sizecoding wiki](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page) where you can find a lot of resources related to sizecoding. All of this triggered the idea of creating *another* Github repo with my favorite mini demos intros: [here it is](https://github.com/cesarmiquel/tiny-demos)
