## ◻ Sizecoding: incredible tiny demos and more

This week HellMood released [a thorough explanation to his 256 byte intro](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Memories). In his article he mentions a *lot* of tiny demos I hadn't head of. Some of them looked really cool. I also hadn't heard of the [sizecoding wiki](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page) where you can find a lot of resources related to sizecoding. All of this triggered the idea of creating *another* Github repo with my favorite mini demos intros: [here it is](https://github.com/cesarmiquel/tiny-demos)

### Ideas💡

- Create a Git repo with a list of my all time favorite tiny demos / intros.

## ◻ Coding fonts

Last week I updated my Ubuntu to **19.10** and in the process seem to have lost the coding font I was using. I searched for whats new in 2020 and after a couple of different tests I settled on two fonts:

### Monoid

[Monoid](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/) - This is a little more condensed so it is a little more crowded. I get good/readable results with 9 or 10.

### Hack

[Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) - I'm currently using Hack Regular 10

![Hack font](imgs/2020-04-20/hack-font.png?1)


I honestly love ❤️  both fonts so I'm kind of constantly switching between them :-).


## ◻ DrupalCon Seattle 2019: interesting talks

There are two interesting talks to look at from DrupalCon Seattle 2019. These are related to UX experience of Drupal compared to, for example, Wordpress.

- "The Admin UX Study - What do Content Editors Want?" - [[WWW]](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/sessions/admin-ux-study-what-do-content-editors-want) [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WNlEgWlR6Q)
- "Layout Builder in the Real World" [[WWW]](https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/sessions/layout-builder-real-world) [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ioyh2QPBw)

## ◻ Wordpress: links and resources I found interesting

- [About the Pantheon COVID-19 Response WordPress Upstream](https://pantheon.io/docs/crisis-response-upstream) The **Pantheon Crisis Response WordPress Upstream** is a specialized WordPress custom upstream, created in response to COVID-19, to enable organizations on the front line to quickly create a production-ready website to provide timely information during a crisis.
- [Elementor WP plugin](https://elementor.com/) - This is a WP plugin to create pages in WP. I should download and test it.
- [Elementor developer documentation](https://developers.elementor.com/) - Elementor also has an open source API so that you can extend it and create your own elements. [[Github project]](https://github.com/elementor/elementor)
- [Elementor showcases](https://elementor.com/blog/category/showcase/)
- [Gutenberg vs. Elementor: ThemeIsle Actually Attempted to Build Their New Site With Both — Here’s What Happened](https://elementor.com/blog/gutenberg-vs-elementor/) - A comparison of these two building tools to create the [Themeisle website](https://themeisle.com/). You can read more about the re-design here: [ThemeIsle Redesign: Here’s How It Went and How Much It Cost - Jul 2019](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/themeisle-redesign-2019/)

### Ideas💡

- Simplify site-building: Wordpress sites like the *elementor.com* are basically blogs with custom pages. Case studies? A blog post. Showcase? A blog post. 

## ◻ Game Console Architectures - from NES -> WII

![WII](imgs/2020-04-20/wii.png)

Browsing through the web I found [this site](https://copetti.org/projects/consoles/) which has detail information about many gaming consoles. Right now its has the following:

- NES
- Mega Drive / Genesis
- Gameboy
- Super Nintendo
- Sega Saturn
- PlayStation
- Nintendo 64
- Dreamcast
- PlayStation 2
- Gameboy Advance
- Game Cube
- Wii

## ◻ Some artists I would like to explore

While taking a course in Domestika the instructor mentioned a couple of artists I would like to explore.

- Power Paola: Colombian comic book artist. [[Blogpost link]](http://powerpaola.blogspot.com/) [[Instagram]](https://www.instagram.com/powerpaola)
- Jean-Michel Basquiat - was an American artist of Haitian and Puerto Rican descent. Basquiat first achieved fame as part of SAMO, an informal graffiti duo who wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the late 1970s, where rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early hip-hop music culture. By the 1980s, his neo-expressionist paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992. [[Wikipedia article]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat)

## ◻ Exploring Calvin and Hobbes: An Exhibition Catalogue

![Exploring Calvin and Hobbes](imgs/2020-04-20/ecah-00.png)

Calvin and Hobbes is unquestionably one of the most popular comic strips of all time. The imaginative world of a boy and his real-only-to-him tiger was first syndicated in 1985 and appeared in more than 2,400 newspapers when Bill Watterson retired on December 31, 1995. Exploring Calvin and Hobbes contains never-before-seen early versions of the character and a new in-depth interview with Bill Watterson.
