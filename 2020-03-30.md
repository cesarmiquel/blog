## Patchbay: a poor mans IFTTT

[Patchbay](https://patchbay.pub/) is, as described on their TL;DR in the wesite: "patchbay.pub is a free web service you can use to implement things like static site hosting, file sharing, cross-platform notifications, webhooks handling, smart home event routing, IoT reporting, job queues, chat systems, bots, etc, all completely serverless and requiring no account creation or authentication. Most implementations need nothing but curl and simple bash snippets."

One of the first cool thing the author achives is to receive a Linux *desktop notification* when a server finishes running some long running job. It basically uses the `notify-send` program to send desktop notifications (`man notify-send`). The trick is to open a channel on Patchbay which when it receives a message fires `norify-send`. This bash command blocks until you do a `curl -X POST` on the other end of the channel.

### Ideas

- See if we can use this when running long tasks in ASYS.


## A simple demonstration of Bell’s theorem involving two observers and no probabilities or inequalities 

Usually understading Bells inequalities is complicated and hard to follow for people not in Quantum Mechanics (and even for Physists!). It turns out that P. K. Aravind has provided a nice *gedanken experiment* which shows you how using entangled particles can be used to "win" a colaborative two player game *with probabilty 1* where clasically the highest that can be achived is to win ~89% of the time. The problem is prsented in the article [Landmark Computer Science Proof Cascades Through Physics and Math](https://www.quantamagazine.org/landmark-computer-science-proof-cascades-through-physics-and-math-20200304/) that appears in the [Quantamagazine blog](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)).

Quoting from this article:

 "But first, to see how the games work, let’s imagine two players, Alice and Bob, and a 3-by-3 grid. A referee assigns Alice a row and tells her to enter a 0 or a 1 in each box so that the digits sum to an odd number. Bob gets a column and has to fill it out so that it sums to an even number. They win if they put the same number in the one place her row and his column overlap. They’re not allowed to communicate.

Under normal circumstances, the best they can do is win 89% of the time. But under quantum circumstances, they can do better.

Imagine Alice and Bob split a pair of entangled particles. They perform measurements on their respective particles and use the results to dictate whether to write 1 or 0 in each box. Because the particles are entangled, the results of their measurements are going to be correlated, which means their answers will correlate as well — meaning they can win the game 100% of the time."

The following image illustrates the problem:

This problem is fully explained and proved in the paper ["A simple demonstration of Bell’s theorem involving two observers and no probabilities or inequalities" by P.K.Aravind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0206070.pdf).
