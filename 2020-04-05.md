## Keyboard over WIFI with an ESP8266

I have an old computer as a meda center which doesn't have bluetooh. I want to be able to connect a "wireless keyboard" to it. Since I have an ESP8266 and some time on my hands I want to write a small APP and be able to connect to the computer and send keystrokes to it from my mobile phone. Ideally I wanted to use an ESP32 and Bluetooth. Unfortunately, at the time and to my knowledge, there is no USB support (even low-speed) for the ESP32. So ... for the moment the plan is to use this project [Software-only ESP8266 USB Device](https://github.com/cnlohr/espusb). More to come soon.
